* My SICP solutions
I have tried several times to complete this damned book, always
getting distracted around the end of chapter 3. Let's see whether
making a gh repo and starting over from scratch helps me stay focused!

Note: I plan on using [[https://call-cc.org/][chicken scheme]] for the vast majority of
topics. I will likely use racket with it's handy compatability
language for the picture exercises.

I want to make my diagrams using
- https://plantuml.com
- http://eschulte.github.io/babel-dev/DONE-integrate-plantuml-support.html

Or, I will just use tikz in org-mode like:
#+name: circle
#+header: :file circle.png
#+header: :results file drawer
#+header: :imagemagick yes
#+header: :headers '("\\usepackage{tikz}")
#+begin_src latex
  \begin{tikzpicture}
      \fill[yellow] (0,0) circle (3cm);
    \end{tikzpicture}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: circle
:results:
[[file:circle.png]]
:end:
