* My SICP solutions
I have tried several times to complete this damned book, always
getting distracted around the end of chapter 3. Let's see whether
making a gh repo and starting over from scratch helps me stay focused!

Note: I plan on using [[https://call-cc.org/][chicken scheme]] for the vast majority of
topics. I will likely use racket with it's handy compatability
language for the picture exercises.
