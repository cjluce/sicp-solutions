*Exercise 1.4:* Observe that our model of evaluation allows for
combinations whose operators are compound expressions.  Use this
observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

#+begin_src scheme
  (define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
    ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
#+end_src

The practical effect of this function is the summation of $a$ and the
absolute value of $b$. The ~if~ determines which operation (~-~ or
~+~) to apply to $a$ and $b$ based on the sign of $b$.
