*Exercise 1.10:* The following procedure computes a mathematical
function called Ackermann's function.

#+begin_src scheme
  (define (A x y)
    (cond ((= y 0) 0)
	  ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
	  ((= y 1) 2)
	  (else (A (- x 1)
		   (A x (- y 1))))))
  (A 1 10) ;; 1024
  (A 2 4) ;; 65536
  (A 3 3) ;; 65536
#+end_src

What are the values of the following expressions?

~(A 1 10)~ evaluates to $1024$

~(A 2 4)~ evaluates to $65536$

~(A 3 3)~ evaluates to $65536$

Consider the following procedures, where `A' is the procedure defined
above:

~(define (f n) (A 0 n))~ is $2n$

~(define (g n) (A 1 n))~ is $2^n$

~(define (h n) (A 2 n))~ is a tetration ($2^(2^(...))$ n times)

~(define (k n) (* 5 n n))~

Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by
the procedures `f', `g', and `h' for positive integer values of n.
For example, `(k n)' computes 5n^2.
