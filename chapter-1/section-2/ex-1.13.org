*Exercise 1.13:* Prove that _Fib_(n) is the closest integer to
[phi]^n/[sqrt](5), where [phi] = (1 + [sqrt](5))/2.  Hint: Let
[illegiblesymbol] = (1 - [sqrt](5))/2.  Use induction and the
definition of the Fibonacci numbers (see section *Note 1-2-2::) to prove
that _Fib_(n) = ([phi]^n - [illegiblesymbol]^n)/[sqrt](5).

Note that $\phi + 1 = \phi^2$ and $\psi + 1 = \psi^2$.

Then the (abbreviated) proof-by-induction is as follows:

(we know the base case holds)

Suppose that $Fib(k) = $(\phi^k - \phi^k) / \sqrt5$. Then, since we
know $Fib(k+1) = Fib(k) + Fib(k-1)$ by the definition of the fibonacci
sequence, it follows that
$Fib(k) = $(\phi^k - \psi^k + \phi^{k-1} - \psi^{k-1}) / \sqrt5$.
Hence, after rearranging and factoring, we get
$Fib(k) = $(\phi^{k-1}(\phi + 1) - \psi^{k-1}(\psi + 1)) / \sqrt5$.
Now, using the note we made above, this reduces to:
$Fib(k) = $(\phi^{k+1} - \psi^{k+1} / \sqrt5$.

Now, let's show that this is indeed the closest integer to
$\phi^n/\sqrt5$.

Notice that, for succesive values of $n$...

| n | $\phi^n$    | $\psi^n$    |
|---+-------------+-------------|
| 0 | 1           | 1           |
| 1 | $\phi$      | $\psi$      |
| 2 | $\phi + 1$  | $\psi + 1$  |
| 3 | $2\phi + 1$ | $2\phi + 1$ |
| 4 | $3\phi + 2$ | $3\phi + 2$ |
| 5 | $5\phi + 3$ | $5\phi + 3$ |
| 6 | $8\phi + 5$ | $8\phi + 5$ |

$\phi^n - \psi^n$ will always reduce to a number of the form:
$m(\phi - \psi)$ for some integer $m$ (and that m happens to be a
fibonacci). Then, notice that $\phi - \psi = \sqrt5$, so we divide by
$\sqrt5$ to cancel this out, et voila!

(ok, not the most rigorous, but it is good enough for this question,
I'd expect).
