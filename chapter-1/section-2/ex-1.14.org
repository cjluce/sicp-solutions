*Exercise 1.14:* Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by
the `count-change' procedure of section *Note 1-2-2:: in making change
for 11 cents.  What are the orders of growth of the space and number
of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?


The count-change wores as follows:
- If a is exactly 0, we should count that as 1 way to make change.
- If a is less than 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.
- If n is 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.

  (define (count-change amount)
    (cc amount 5))

  (define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
    (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
	  ((or (< amount 0) (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 0)
	  (else (+ (cc amount
		       (- kinds-of-coins 1))
		   (cc (- amount
			  (first-denomination kinds-of-coins))
		       kinds-of-coins)))))

  (define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)
    (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)
	  ((= kinds-of-coins 2) 5)
	  ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)
	  ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)
	  ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))

Note, in my tree I, am going to reduce any call of the form ~(cc n 1)~
to $1$ (since it will just result in an essentially linear branch of
adding zero to the result of ~(cc (- n 1) 1)~ until $n = 1$, at which
point the next call will result in $1$).

The order of growth in space is $O(n)$ and the growth in time is
$O(n^3)$ where the 3 comes from the number of denominations of coins.
