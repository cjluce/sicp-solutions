*Exercise 2.9:* _The "width" of an interval is half of the difference
between its upper and lower bounds_.  The width is a measure of the
uncertainty of the number specified by the interval.  For some
arithmetic operations the width of the result of combining two
intervals is a function only of the widths of the argument intervals,
whereas for others the width of the combination is not a function of
the widths of the argument intervals.

Show that the width of the sum (or difference) of two intervals is a
function only of the widths of the intervals being added (or
subtracted).

Let $I=(a,b)$ and $J=(c,d)$. Then we calculate the sum to be
$$I+J=(a+c,b+d)$$. The width of $I+J$ is then given by:
$\frac{b+d - (a+c)}{2}$. Then, with some algebra:
\[
\frac{b+d - (a+c)}{2} = \frac{b - a}{2} + \frac{d - c}{2} = width(I) + width(J)
\].

Give examples to show that this is not true for
multiplication or division.

Consider the intervals $I=(-1,1)$ and $J=(2,3)$. We can see that
$wI=1$ and $wJ=0.5$. But, calculating the product gives:
$K=I*J=(-3,3)$ and $$wK=\frac{3 - (-3)}{2}$$.
